Sanbox: Learning: Public repository for a data science class in 2023

This repository is for educational use, overal project have 2 parts, the first one
is to analyze day sales granularity data on a time series or other ML models that 
could be used on tests.

Data analisys will be performed on python (colab, jupyter or spyder) or on R
studio, all toos and cand complementary tools would be described ad hoc.

Documentation will use html or pdf notebooks, as well as .ipynb (for notebooks)
or any other file. The presentation and data dictionaries could use a office 
stack (MS or docs), and data visualization could use PowerBI.

Source data is on universal format (.csv) as well as master table or any other
granularity agregations that makes sense to amterialize, the source have 2
tables wich are: city data, product data and sales data, the sales data is big
enought to disable single on-premise tools (like excel) to deal with it.
